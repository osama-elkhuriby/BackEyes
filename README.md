“Surveillance cameras system
Based on AI & ML”

## Abstract

Considering the digital transformation and artificial intelligence technology,
solution of many daily problems has become highly dependent on it
One of these daily problems that occur in every Egyptian home is the question:
How do we provide security?
Our project starts with a monitoring system that provides safety to the user
anywhere and uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
then our application will warn the user when any abnormal behavior occurs
The following list shows the main objectives of the project:-
- User profile who can edit the number of cameras in each of his
rooms.
- When an abnormal act occurs such as (theft - strange people in the room or
around the house ...etc.)Take pictures of the event using artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms.
- The user can see the warning message through the mobile application.
- User can add their own cameras to our database after reviewing them.
